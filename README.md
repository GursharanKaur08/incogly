Have you ever been in a situation where you nailed every aspect of the conversation but still couldn't crack the deal. Maybe because the other person had a bias against you :eyes:
Have you ever wanted an app where you could practice for mock interviews with your peers but without revealing them your identity or knowing theirs?

Say Hi:wave: to Incog.ly, the first ever truly anonymous video calling platform.

### Features

2. Face and Emotion detection to simulate real conversations.
3. Face and Audio masking for complete anonymity
4. Clean UI <3
